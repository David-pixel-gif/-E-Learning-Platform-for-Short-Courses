TL;DR: Donâ€™t cut it. Leave Prisma Studio running in that terminal (so you can inspect data any time) and open a new terminal to run the backend and frontend.

## npx prisma studio - TO INSPECT AS EXPLAINED ABOVE 


Quick sanity checks

Run each and confirm:

:: Shows your Prisma and CLI versions
npx prisma -v

:: Confirms schema path is correct
type prisma\schema.prisma

:: Lists migrations created by 'migrate dev'
dir prisma\migrations

## SO OPEN ANOTHER TERMINAL AND RUN BACKEND WHILST YOU ARE ABLE TO INSPECT THE TERMINAL
